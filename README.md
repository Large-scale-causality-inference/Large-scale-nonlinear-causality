 Large-scale nonlinear Granger causality for inferring directed dependence from short multivariate time-series data

## Background

The code converts multivariate time-series data to graph adjacency matrix that represents causal relationships. 

## Contributions

By modeling interactions with nonlinear state-space transformations from limited observational data, lsNGC identifies casual relations with no explicit a priori assumptions on functional interdependence between component time series in a computationally efficient manner.
