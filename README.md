 Large-scale nonlinear Granger causality for inferring directed dependence from short multivariate time-series data

## Background
- Identifying nonlinear and directed relations between components of a complex system, especially from simultaneously observed time series, is an actively growing area of research. 
- By modeling interactions with nonlinear state-space transformations from limited observational data, lsNGC identifies casual relations with no explicit a priori assumptions on functional interdependence between component time series in a computationally efficient manner.

## Contributions
- Here, we introduce large-scale nonlinear Granger causality (lsNGC) which facilitates conditional Granger causality between two multivariate time series conditioned on a large number of confounding time series with a small number of observations.
- The code converts multivariate time-series data to graph adjacency matrix that represents causal relationships. 

## Workflow



## Results
- To evaluate the approach, several benchmark simulations are considered and performance is compared to four state-of-the-art approaches.
